1.Clone the project

2.npm install in backend and frontend path 

3. npm run dev for the backend.
   
4. go to the client path and run npm run dev for the front.
  
5. Create a database called task_pj and deactivate line 8 of the index.js to execute the model made with sequelize and in line 17 of the same file place force: true, to see the changes in real time, then deactivate it.
   
6. Create an .env file at the root of the project, where the backed is and place the credentials

  PORT= 
  
  DB_HOST=

  DB_USER=
  
  DB_PASSWORD=
  
  DB_DATABASE=
  
  DB_DIALECT=

Entering the credentials of each person who clones this repository is always 
DB_DIALECT=postgres and in my case PORT=3000
